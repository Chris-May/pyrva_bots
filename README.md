## Proposed Features

- [X] raffle bot
- [ ] Meetup
    - scrapes the meetup API for relavant info and posts this info to discord
- [ ] jobs
	- user would post a job and it would show up in the `#job_board` channel
	- have a form to fill out
- [ ] announcements
	- user would post an announcement and bot would post it in the announcements section
- [ ] what to learn
	- it would be fun to have /whattolearn spit out a random python package or concept if people are bored. I'm sure there's a way to query for a random package on PyPI
- [ ] Assign badge to people attending specific events
